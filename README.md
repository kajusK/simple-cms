Yet another simple CMS
=================================

Don't take this as a reliable software, it was written to practise php and learn something new. AFAIK the only
project running on this CMS is my personal webpage.

Requires:
---------

	 modrewrite, mysqli and php5

Installation:
-------------

	set database in config.php and run install.php 	

	admin interface can be found at http://address.foo/path/to/dir/admin
